# ðŸš€ NextJS Portfolio
This portfolio was made for me to be able to showcase my experience using the NextJS framework, it was launched using vercel on this url:

[portfolio-flax-tau-90.vercel.app](portfolio-flax-tau-90.vercel.app)

![To-do app](./public/images/preview.webp "Screenshot of the Portfolio")

# âš¡ About
I created this app because unfortunately I am not allowed to showcase any of the projects I did for any of the companies I worked for, which makes it harder to find a new job, I have experience, I have the knowledge, and I wanted to be able to show it right here in my own project.

I will point out that I am not a designer, never have been, and most likely never will be.
